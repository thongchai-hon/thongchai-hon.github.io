        <h1 id="title">Identity and Values </h1>
        <h2 class = "subtitle">
                Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. <br>
                Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
                the decision you made and the consequences of <br>
                the action you took.</h2>

        <div class="Introduction">
        <p>I use to work in a wholesale supermarket and one day i discovered that an entire pallet of chicken breast <br>
           had expired on the weekend, while the weekend staff should have caught onto this, it was my mistake for not <br>
           checking the short date on the friday.<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I had the choice to either keep quiet, freeze the chicken and sell it later or<br>
        to discard it and cost the company. I chose to discard the chicken as it was a health and safety risk and <br>
        did not want to comprismise my integrity.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        The consequences of this decision was a mild telling off, and while it cost the company a few grand of lost stock it<br>
        it eventually led to a consistent date checking process as well as an extra staff member working the same department<br>
        </p>

        <h2 class = "subtitle">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
        <p>
        This is a tough one, as i've grown up with a wall of seperation from my own thai culture, due to having grown up in foster<br>
        care since age 12 and moving to new zealand at age 2. However I have been told that the Thai culture value perseverance <br>
        which I feel is something I value as well. <br>
        </p>

        <h2 class = "subtitle">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h2>
        <p>
        My strengths are the ability to keep trying and powering through difficult tasks, as well as having an optimistic outlook<br>
        on challenging situations. My limitations are a lack of organisation and difficulty asking for help <br>
        </p>

        <h2 class = "subtitle">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your <br>
            learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>
        <p>
        I think that my ability to perseveer will come in handy when I come across difficult problems in my coding journey <br>
        quite often if I can't figure a problem out after trying for a while I will atleast laugh about it. <br>
        </p>

        <h2 class = "subtitle">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, <br>
            but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your <br>
            reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h2>
        <p>
        I once had a band practice for an upcoming gig with some musicians that I don't usually work with, when there was no <br>
        disagreements about the arrangements there was a ridiculous amount of "noodling". This eventually led to tensions <br>
        boiling over and some snarky and harsh comments between band memebers and myself included. I decided to try lighten <br>
        by saying something silly, it made the tensions lighten a little and we eventually agreed on arrangements.<br>
        Moving forward I would come into rehearsals with a mindset of knowing that everyone wants the same thing <br>
        to play a good show, and that is achieved when the band is working together well first. <br>

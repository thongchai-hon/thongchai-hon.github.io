            What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
    
            <div class="Introduction">
            <p>To create better programmers that can co-operate and work well in a team. Being able <br>
                to understand yourself and others will be a huge advandtage for this.<br>

            What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning</h2>
    
            <div class="Introduction">
            <p>I found it very difficult to self reflect as it is something<br>
                that I do not do often<br>
            </p>

         <h2 class = "subtitle">
            Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing <br>
            on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
    
             <div class="Introduction">
            <p>It is a skill that is not often taught in a programming course, however it is very important<br>
            </p>
            
         <h2 class = "subtitle">
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just <br>
            used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answe</h2>
    
             <div class="Introduction">
            <p>I believe that it was a good use of my time, as it helped me interact with my cohort members<br>
